# **Refresh Token Validation in JwtAuthLib**

JwtAuthLib provides a secure and efficient way to handle refresh tokens for token rotation in your Node.js applications. Refresh tokens are essential for providing a seamless user experience by allowing users to refresh their access tokens without the need for reauthentication.

## **How Refresh Token Validation Works**

When a user requests to refresh their access token, JwtAuthLib performs a series of validation checks to ensure the request is valid and secure. The refresh token validation process includes the following steps:

1. **Token Extraction**: JwtAuthLib extracts the refresh token from the request using a customizable token extraction method. By default, it uses the "Bearer" scheme in the "Authorization" header.
2. **Token Verification**: The extracted refresh token is verified against the refresh token secret stored in the JwtAuthLib configuration. If the token is valid, the next steps are executed.
3. **Token Decoding**: JwtAuthLib decodes the refresh token payload to obtain the subject identifier (**`sub`**) and other relevant information.
4. Refresh **Token WhiteListing**: Before generating a new access token, JwtAuthLib checks if the refresh token exists in the Redis storage. If the refresh token is not found in the whitelist, it indicates that the token has been compromised or expired, and the request is denied. this is to prevent token replay
5. **New Access Token Generation**: If the refresh token passes all validation checks, JwtAuthLib generates a new access token for the user. This new token will have a new expiration time, allowing the user to continue accessing protected resources without reauthentication.
6. **New Refresh Token Generation**: If the refresh token passes all validation checks, JwtAuthLib generates a new  refresh token for the user, with the refresh token previously sent along in the request deleted

## **Sample Usage of Refresh Token Validation**

```tsx
typescriptCopy code
import AuthLib, { Extractor } from "auth-lib";

const authLib = new AuthLib({
  jwtConfig: {
    // Your JWT configuration here...
  },
  redisUrl: "redis://localhost:6379", // Replace with your Redis server URL
  // Other configuration options...
});

// Route handler to refresh access token
app.post("/auth/refresh", authLib.handleRefreshToken());

// Route handler to revoke access token
app.post("/auth/logout", authLib.handleRevokeAccessToken());

```

In the example above, the **`/auth/refresh`** route is protected by JwtAuthLib's built-in **`handleRefreshToken`** handler. When a user makes a POST request to this route with a valid refresh token, JwtAuthLib performs the necessary validation steps to ensure the refresh token is valid and has not been blacklisted. If all checks pass, a new access and refresh token is generated and returned in the response, the refresh token previously provided will be deleted from the redis store.

## **Conclusion**

With JwtAuthLib's refresh token validation feature, you can provide a secure and seamless user experience by allowing users to refresh their access tokens without frequent reauthentication. This feature enhances the security of your Node.js applications and ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
